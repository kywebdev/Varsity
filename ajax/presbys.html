            <p>More than a tagline — an<br />exceptional group of communities</p>

        <div class="sidebar-content">
            <p><a href="http://www.presbysinspiredlife.org" target="_blank">Presby’s Inspired Life</a>, a large non-profit, multi-site group in the Greater Philadelphia area, faced a major challenge: forming one cohesive brand while keeping the personalities of its individual communities alive. We created one overarching theme, “Exceptional. Without Exception,” and then showed how each community is exceptional in its own unique way.</p>
            <p>For <a href="http://www.rydalpark.org" target="_blank">Rydal Park</a>, a clever illustrated campaign designed to appeal to a sophisticated consumer showcased the community’s breadth of on-campus offerings and convenience to the attractions of Center City.</p>
            <p>For <a href="http://www.explorerosemont.org" target="_blank">Rosemont</a>, we appealed to its upscale prospects by designing a print campaign with an elegant look and feel that reflected the grandeur of the mansion that is the focal point of the Rosemont estate.</p>
            <p>For <a href="http://wwwr.rydalwaters.org" target="_blank">Rydal Waters</a>, a new cottage expansion, eye-catching print ads drove the target market to an easy-to-navigate landing page for more information and event registration. We created buzz about the new expansion through an illustrated campaign with a bright, fresh color palette that appealed to a younger demographic. Colorful coordinating collateral was given out at each event, and direct mail enticed consumers to attend appealing, complimentary events.</p>
