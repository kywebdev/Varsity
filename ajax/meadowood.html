            <p><a href="http://www.meadowood.net" target="_blank">Meadowood Senior Living</a> is a nonprofit, fee-for-service Life Plan Community in suburban Philadelphia. We were tapped to guide the community through a repositioning, ultimately defining its brand for the future. We developed Meadowood’s website and collateral and have been partnering on its entire marketing communications plan and implementation, helping the community reach its first yearly sales goal in six months, continues to exceed its sales goals year-over-year and increase occupancy nearly 10% in six years. Meadowood’s resident-focused brand position, “It all begins with you,” ultimately became the centerpiece of a campaign in which seniors told the story of their love for the community in their own words. We brought their heartfelt stories to life through videos, print ads and direct mail that drove to online videos and event sign-ups.</p>
