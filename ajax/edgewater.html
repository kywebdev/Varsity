            <p>The challenge for Edgewater, a modified Life Care Community in West Des Moines, Iowa, was reaching the pre-sales goal for its new independent living expansion. We launched sales & marketing efforts using a Priority Program, sale training and a heavy event strategy. Promoted by a mix of direct mail, print, digital and a web landing page, this program achieved the necessary 75% pre-sale requirement in four months.</p>

Varsity's strategic thinking, forthright recommendations and collaborative approach helped us achieve our pre-sale targets well within the projected time frame, enabling us to begin construction before the harsh winter weather hits Iowa."<span class="quote-name">â€” Rob Kretzinger, President & CEO, Wesleylife</span></blockquote>
