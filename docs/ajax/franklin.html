            <p>Our research process uncovered the astonishing dedication to detail found at every level of the Franklin organization — from the founder’s handwritten notes to an associate’s attention to a resident’s drink preferences. The resulting brand narrative and coordinating print campaign for <a href="http://www.franklinpark.org" target="_blank">Franklin Park Communities</a> centered around the concept that the little things are actually the big things.</p>

    <blockquote>"Franklin Park has always been a culture-oriented company, but we wanted to more effectively articulate our culture and our rich heritage to an increasingly demanding consumer. That is why we engaged Varsity. They understand the ”why” of companies and provided the guidance and process to develop a value proposition that is clearly rooted in our founders’ values that permeate our organization today."<span class="quote-name">— Luke L. Classen, President, Franklin Companies</span></blockquote>
