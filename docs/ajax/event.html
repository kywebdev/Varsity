            <p>The most effective way to get potential residents interested in a community is for them to experience it for themselves. That’s why a strong event strategy can make a big difference in building occupancy. For virtually all of our clients, event marketing is an important piece of the overall strategic plan. A few examples:</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.dunwoodyvillage.org" target="_blank">Dunwoody Village</a>, a Life Plan Community in the Philadelphia area, had to delay its marketing, pushing back the construction schedule on its new carriage home expansion. To sell homes quickly and gain momentum to secure financing, we communicated an event strategy through direct mail advertising, driving to a landing page where prospects could make reservations. Attendees were not only age- and income-qualified, but genuinely interested in the carriage home project. Leads were converted to sales, and Dunwoody was able to break ground before winter set in.</p>
            <p>At <a href="http://www.discoversaintjohns.org" target="_blank">Saint John’s On The Lake</a> in Milwaukee, our direct mail and print marketing campaign did double duty: generating hundreds of leads for its new tower expansion and boosting brand awareness of the community as a whole. Digital retargeting ads reinforced the print and direct mail, appearing on websites frequently visited by potential residents and driving them to the new Saint John’s mobile-responsive landing page, where they could register for events and learn more about the community.</p>
            <p>At <a href="http://www.homesteadvillage.org" target="_blank">Homestead Village</a>, a Life Plan Community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, an integrated strategy of events, direct mail, print, digital and web advertising has been the cornerstone of our sales & marketing efforts. Events have regularly delivered a steady stream of potential residents to the community’s new expansion.</p>
