            <p><a href="http://www.discovercls.org" target="_blank">Christian Living Services</a> (CLS) wanted to reinvent itself as an innovative new company offering senior living consulting, management and development services while leveraging its parent organization’s 40 years of trusted experience. We completed a full rebranding — including brand narrative, logo, name and videos — which set the new “Cappella Living Solutions” apart from its traditional roots, though still keeping the equity of the well-known initials, “CLS.”</p>
