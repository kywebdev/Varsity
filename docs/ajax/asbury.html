It had been struggling with independent living occupancy (83%) and wanted to give its sales & marketing staff the tools to be successful by providing senior-living sales training for its sales & admissions staff. After putting the sales tactics into practice and implementing recommendations for improving the sales environment, Asbury Pointe reported being on the verge of 100% occupancy within six months of the training.</p>
