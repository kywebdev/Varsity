            <p>The <a href="http://www.paculturechangecoalition.org" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Culture Change Coalition</a>, a nonprofit organization that empowers seniors to find their voices, needed a new brand that truly conveyed its mission. Using the memorable acronym “V.O.I.C.E.” and a clean graphic of the keystone state, we created an entirely new brand system, including narrative, name and logo. We rolled out the new tone of the organization in videos and collateral.</p>
